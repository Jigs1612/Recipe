## Overview


This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Recipe Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-Y1W76gkW). The goal of this challenge is to build a recipe page that is both functional and responsive. The page is built using **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework, to create a clean, mobile-first design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, adjusting to mobile and desktop screens.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for a fast and efficient development process.
- **Custom Fonts**: Incorporated custom fonts as specified in the design guide.
- **Semantic HTML**: Ensured accessibility and readability with well-structured HTML.
  
## Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **VSCode** (or any code editor of your choice)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **GitHub** (for hosting the project)
